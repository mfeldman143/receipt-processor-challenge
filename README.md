# Receipt Processor Backend Challenge by Michael Feldman
Hello! My name is Michael and I appreciate the opportunity to undertake the Backend Engineer challenge for Fetch Rewards.

Introduction
This project is an implementation of the Receipt Processor as described in the Backend Exercise provided by Fetch Rewards.

## Setup and Installation
1. Ensure you have Go and Docker installed.
2. Install the required Go module with: go get github.com/google/uuid
3. Clone the repository.
4. Navigate to the project directory.
5. Build the Docker image using: docker build -t receipt-processor-go .
6. Run the Docker container using:
7. Access the API on [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

## API Endpoints

- **Process Receipts**: 
- Method: `POST`
- Path: `/receipts/process`
- Description: Accepts a JSON receipt and returns an ID for the receipt.

- **Get Points**: 
- Method: `GET`
- Path: `/receipts/{id}/points`
- Description: Accepts an ID and returns the number of points awarded for the associated receipt.

## Thoughts on the Exercise

The take-home exercise approach is appreciated as it allows me to showcase my skills in a more relaxed environment. I agree that this method can indeed help in evaluating the real skills of a candidate, rather than solely relying on the resume.

## Location and Availability

I am currently located in Madison, Wisconsin. Upon receiving an offer, I am ready to start within the timeframe mentioned.

## Submission

I have submitted my exercise through the provided Greenhouse link.

## Further Discussions

I look forward to any feedback on the code and am eager to discuss my implementation in further stages of the interview process.

## Contact

If there are any questions or if you would like to discuss the project further, I am available for a Zoom call at your convenience.

Thank you and I eagerly await the next steps in the process!

Kind regards,
Michael




# Receipt Processor

Build a webservice that fulfils the documented API. The API is described below. A formal definition is provided 
in the [api.yml](./api.yml) file, but the information in this README is sufficient for completion of this challenge. We will use the 
described API to test your solution.

Provide any instructions required to run your application.

Data does not need to persist when your application stops. It is sufficient to store information in memory. There are too many different database solutions, we will not be installing a database on our system when testing your application.

## Language Selection

You can assume our engineers have Go and Docker installed to run your application. Go is our preferred language, but it is not a requirement for this exercise.

If you are using a language other than Go, the engineer evaluating your submission may not have an environment ready for your language. Your instructions should include how to get an environment in any OS that can run your project. For example, if you write your project in Javascript simply stating to "run `npm start` to start the application" is not sufficient, because the engineer may not have NPM. Providing a docker file and the required docker command is a simple way to satisfy this requirement.

## Submitting Your Solution

Provide a link to a public repository, such as GitHub or BitBucket, that contains your code to the provided link through Greenhouse.

## Summary of API Specification

### Endpoint: Process Receipts

* Path: `/receipts/process`
* Method: `POST`
* Payload: Receipt JSON
* Response: JSON containing an id for the receipt.

Description:

Takes in a JSON receipt (see example in the example directory) and returns a JSON object with an ID generated by your code.

The ID returned is the ID that should be passed into `/receipts/{id}/points` to get the number of points the receipt
was awarded.

How many points should be earned are defined by the rules below.

Reminder: Data does not need to survive an application restart. This is to allow you to use in-memory solutions to track any data generated by this endpoint.

Example Response:
```json
{ "id": "7fb1377b-b223-49d9-a31a-5a02701dd310" }
```

## Endpoint: Get Points

* Path: `/receipts/{id}/points`
* Method: `GET`
* Response: A JSON object containing the number of points awarded.

A simple Getter endpoint that looks up the receipt by the ID and returns an object specifying the points awarded.

Example Response:
```json
{ "points": 32 }
```

---

# Rules

These rules collectively define how many points should be awarded to a receipt.

* One point for every alphanumeric character in the retailer name.
* 50 points if the total is a round dollar amount with no cents.
* 25 points if the total is a multiple of `0.25`.
* 5 points for every two items on the receipt.
* If the trimmed length of the item description is a multiple of 3, multiply the price by `0.2` and round up to the nearest integer. The result is the number of points earned.
* 6 points if the day in the purchase date is odd.
* 10 points if the time of purchase is after 2:00pm and before 4:00pm.


## Examples

  "total": "35.35"
}
```
```text
Total Points: 28
Breakdown:
     6 points - retailer name has 6 characters
    10 points - 4 items (2 pairs @ 5 points each)
     3 Points - "Emils Cheese Pizza" is 18 characters (a multiple of 3)
                item price of 12.25 * 0.2 = 2.45, rounded up is 3 points
     3 Points - "Klarbrunn 12-PK 12 FL OZ" is 24 characters (a multiple of 3)
                item price of 12.00 * 0.2 = 2.4, rounded up is 3 points
     6 points - purchase day is odd
  + ---------
  = 28 points

# FAQ

### How will this exercise be evaluated?
An engineer will review the code you submit. At a minimum they must be able to run the service and the service must provide the expected results. You
should provide any necessary documentation within the repository. While your solution does not need to be fully production ready, you are being evaluated so
put your best foot forward.

### I have questions about the problem statement
For any requirements not specified via an example, use your best judgment to determine the expected result.

### Can I provide a private repository?
If at all possible, we prefer a public repository because we do not know which engineer will be evaluating your submission. Providing a public repository
ensures a speedy review of your submission. If you are still uncomfortable providing a public repository, you can work with your recruiter to provide access to
the reviewing engineer.

### How long do I have to complete the exercise?
There is no time limit for the exercise. Out of respect for your time, we designed this exercise with the intent that it should take you a few hours. But, please
take as much time as you need to complete the work.
